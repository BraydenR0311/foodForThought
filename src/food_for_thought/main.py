# This program as a whole is a demonstration of my OOP skills.
# It comes complete with:
# Abstract base classes that define scenes
# Scene/state management
# Components of the game represented as objects, some of which inherit from one
# another
# Some caveats:
#   - the only instance properties that 'should be' allowed directly accessed
#   by other classes are images and rects. I couldn't be bothered to make
#   methods to allow this, and it seems in the spirit of pygame to allow
#   direct access to these.
